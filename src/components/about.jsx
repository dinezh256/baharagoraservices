              &emsp; &nbsp; The creators of this website are just like all
              people from Baharagora. They know how tough it is to get someone
              who can repair something on time, who can do some small
              constructions. It takes days to get a service man. Being tired
              from getting no one to do the work on time, it turned out that
              more or less everyone in Baharagora has gone through the same
              problem. With this, the idea to bring all the Service Workers
              under one roof was born.
